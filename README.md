# Transverse-bifurcation-of-viscous-slow-MHD-shocks
This repository contains the notebook with symbolic computations in SAGE for the paper "Transverse bifurcation of viscous slow MHD shocks", by Blake Barker, Rafael Monteiro, and Kevin Zumbrun. The code is not intended to be optimized,  and in several parts (believe it or not) we chose clarity to the detriment of efficiency.  The preprint can be found in https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09153

## Update

The paper has been published as

Barker, Blake, Rafael Monteiro, and Kevin Zumbrun. "Transverse bifurcation of viscous slow MHD shocks." Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena 420 (2021): 132857.
